Suppose we created a new customer by forking from the Spider repository. Since Day-1 DAG developments are not versioned, we will not know the exact state of the customer. Hence, upgrading the customer code will be cumbersome.\n\n> Info: There is a situation where this example is not valid. The boxes in Day-1 DAG usually run another library. The customer code gets updated when we upgrade a library to the latest version.The problem occurs when someone displaces, removes, or adds a box in the DAG.\n\nThe second problem is scalability. In case multiple customers are copied from the Spider code, there are several versions of the DAG we have to maintain.\n\n## Why is this change needed?",

What rocks provides is just a pipeline definition, a text file that specifies which task should run and when.\n\nWe need an “agent” that takes this pipeline definition, and generate an Airflow DAG from it.\n\nBesides, Day-1 DAG is not only rocks pipeline.

Rocks packages will know their internal package requirements. However, this is not enough to start using it on the production. Passing unit and integration tests is only sufficient for creating a release. There are non-negligible external factors which, such as the data to run the pipelines on. Therefore, we run the end-to-end tests. However, since the system consists of many independent parts, each of them should be tested in their namespace and they should not block each other. For example, noob can fail the end-to-end tests, but rocket could be successful. This should not prevent rocket part to use the latest rocks release. In this case, noob should not use the last version of its. This should be controlled by constraint files.",

If any of the steps succeeded, upgrade rocks version in internal-packages.lock\n\nThis scenario solves the dependency between the products, however it is still error-prone. For example, if noob changes it is public interface (e.g. forecast output location) and its consumer, rocket, does not update its code accordingly, rocket tests will be failed. Therefore, noob will be able to increase its version while rocket can’t. Additionally, the new version of noob will keep breaking the rocket. A suggestion to this problem would be to increase versions in internal-packages.lock and constraint file after all tests are successful. However, this will still keep the products dependent even when they have independent internal problems since we will not be aware of the reason of the failure in runtime.\n\nWe could add a separate API compliance test before e2e tests to detect interface related errors, and keep incrementing package versions independently.\n\n### Challenges",

Namespace packages would probably end up with multiple wheels. It might be complex to maintain installation steps.\n3. Namespace packages require a semantic versioning for each subpackage. We probably will not be able to use pbr.\n4. Independent end-to-end tests that change the public API would break other products and yet be able to deploy erroneous versions.\n5. warp library is always been considered as the core library on python and pyspark side. Therefore, noob, rocket, and others use warp as their dependency as well. So, determining and specifying warp version on the rocks library could be tricky. We might consider adding warp to add dependencies of noob, rocket etc, and let the pip resolver try to handle the possible conflicts.",

We might need to add protective steps to build lifecycle. Additionally, teams should be in sync of their dependencies. (i.e. if noob depends on pandas < 1.0 but rocket requires pandas > 1.0, there will be conflict and rocks installation would be failed)\n\n### Backwards Compatibility\n\nThis proposal does not effect the code side, and not necessarily have to be backward compatible. Any customer using rocks library should be encouraged to use the new system. However, if we want to make it backward compatible, we can specify internal packages as extras [8]\n\n### Usability\n\nUsers should be able to install and maintain rocks and the other underlying libraries easily by one command:\n\n```\npip install invent_rocks\n```\n\nor\n\n```\npip install invent_rocks invent_rocks.opal invent_rocks.rocket\n```",

More stable data validationFor each project, project members are trying to figure out if the data is valid by using their own scripts and know-how. We can make it the same and better for every project.\n3. (a maybe benefit) Easier to force the customer to stick to Invent Data RequirementMaybe, this way we can force our customers to provide the data according to our structure more easily. I am not sure this works in real life.\n\n# Why Needed\n\nBecause we are doing the same manual controls (not the same actually see #2 above) over and over.\n\n# Suggested Implementation\n\nTwo alternatives based on discussions on the Jira task.

Therefore, noob, rocket, and others use warp as their dependency as well. So, determining and specifying warp version on the rocks library could be tricky. We might consider adding warp to add dependencies of noob, rocket etc, and let the pip resolver try to handle the possible conflicts.\n3. Letting pip resolver handle the possible conflicts might be error prone. We might need to add protective steps to build lifecycle. Additionally, teams should be in sync of their dependencies.

Rocks builds fail and prevent sub-products to be released. This may be caused by either a software defect in the rocks library, or underlying libraries it uses (internal or external).

In fact, since we distribute the packages, it will not be backward compatible. However, if we want to make it backward compatible, we should maintain a second setup mechanism which packages the entire rocks library as a whole and deploy it.\n\n### Usability\n\nUsers should be able to install and maintain rocks and the other underlying libraries easily by one command:\n\n```\npip install invent_rocks.noob\n```\n\nor\n\n```\npip install invent_rocks invent_rocks.opal invent_rocks.rocket\n```",

When a change is required in these tables, the relevant data-feed module is also changed. These modules are not customer specific, so all customers are affected from the changes. However, since the way customers send data is not changed for such reasons, the changes made in the document pose a problem for live customers.",

Thus, it is not as simple as it seems. Besides, even if it were that simple, this process would have to be done for all live customers at the same time, definitely not scalable.\n\n### Backwards Compatible data-feed\n\nRelevant data-feed module can be changed backwards compatible. In other words, the module works in the same way when input data format is any version of the data-requirements. For a simple column rename example in the motivation part, the module produces same output when the name of the column is b or b_2. This approach complicates the data-feed module and gives it another responsibility.",

For a repository residing in the [Sparky](https://gitlab.com/invent-analytics/sparky) group, it should surprise nobody. However, with (not so) recent developments in the Rocks like [pipeline.py](https://gitlab.com/invent-analytics/sparky/rocks/-/blob/master/rocks/pipeline.py) have made it the main source for our entire product pipelines. But even though our pipelines consist mostly of spark jobs, it has other jobs in them too, most prominently, Linear Programming/Optimization jobs. As it goes, we can expect to have our pipelines contain a higher percentage of non-spark jobs.",

For this purpose, we propose to introduce another layer of abstraction (as in base classes) to Rocks. We also will need to adapt our pipeline operations to handle non-spark jobs inheriting the new abstractions.\n\n## What problem does it solve?",

For example, our base classes instantiate Spark Sessions, which would be not optimal in any task non-spark related to say the least. Also our pipeline operations require tasks to specify certain properties like, application_args or dependencies, but notwhere to run them(because they are assumed to be ran in spark clusters), which could be different in non-spark cases.\n\n## Why is this change needed?",

But we will also require our tasks to be Rocks tasks. So it is important to be able to put a non-spark task in Rocks.\n- Since our development efforts has focused on Rocks in the last year, this repo has a better backbone than most of our repos, if not all. Even some external effort in warp.config has been developed with Rocks and its module hierarchy in mind. When we want to apply what we learned and what we developed so far to non-spark jobs, we need to (unnecessarily) replicate the same stuff in other repos. (example, lots of similarities with Rocks needed to be repeated)\n\n## Suggested Implementation\n\n### Specification",

Some of those data are domain-specific and there are unlimited variations for the content and names for this kind of data. For instance, if the customer uses data for packaging size, varied columns like box, can, bottle, case, pallet, package etc. can be received as crucial data from the customer. Adding all of them to the data requirements document isn’t a feasible and manageable solution.

All teams can implement their code with their favorite language. After the implementation, AWS API Gateway (or any similar product of other CSPs) can be used for exposing code in need of swiftness. APIs don’t need to be RESTful since we are not managing resources here and that would be unreasonable, but then again, namings should be logical and explicit.\n\n- We should be able support both sync and async flows since some tasks can be time consuming.\n- All APIs should have multiple environments (test and prod at minimum) and should support versioning via url or header.\n- All headers cheetah sends via request starting with x-cheetah-* (may be changed during implementation) also must be present in request (async flow) event if they look like gibberish.\n\nDomain naming alternatives",

It means, the interaction between software and human intelligence creates the value. In other words, operationalizing the domain knowledge of humans with software generates value.\n\nA data-driven software consists of \"pipelines.\" Each pipeline step performs operations like data transformation, feature engineering, modeling, optimization, and reporting. Operationalization of these consist of the following steps:\n\n- Develop\n- Test\n- Version\n- Deploy\n- Monitor\n\nThis is a continuous process. Meaning, we need to continuously develop, test and deploy new versions of the software, and monitor events and metrics in real-time. Experimenting with new ideas, testing them and deploying them to the production should be one click away.",

Another approach would be saving these kind of information as metadata and use it as an index.\n\nAnother example would be the communication between systems. Think of a prediction service that makes predictions with latest trained model. How can it find the latest model? Maybe we can use a configuration file. What happens a new model trained then? Instead, prediction service can ask for the latest model to the metadata service, without human interaction or configuration.\n\nThere might be alternative solutions for these problems, but, using a metadata service reduces the amount of work required, and makes MLOps components transparent and accessible.\n\nTesting",

However, different namespaces have different conventions and this situation makes it harder to use. Therefore, we should develop a unified config management approach to provide stable and user friendly configuration.\n\n## What problem does it solve?\n\nThe most important problem that can be solved by a new Config System in rocks is having an unified configuration approach. So, one should simply use same structure of config files at every single part of the application.",

Currently, all subpackages of rocks handle their own validation logic and write plenty of code to apply some schema and content based validation. We should have reusable validators that can validate the input configuration.\n\nAdditionally, it is often confusing what is a configuration element and what is a runtime application argument element. We should simplify this ambiguity and treat them similarly.\n\n## Why is this change needed?\n\nTo make rocks more stable and user-friendly, we should have a solid config system.

However, simple validations such as type-checks should be commonly handled.\n- Application arguments should override config values.\n- It is not a common pattern to base PipelineStep classes from ConfigModel classes, as most of them behave like data-classes but PipelineStep classes implement a business logic. Therefore, we should provide an abstraction level for Config Model classes and make our system independent of third party config validation libraries.\n- Config will be independent of class/module hierarchy. Config will be accessed with section names.\n- It is alright to use multiple files for configuration, but we should specify the namespaces.",
