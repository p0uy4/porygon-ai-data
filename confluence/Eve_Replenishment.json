Check if your name appears in the row. If it does, you are on duty for the day. You may also check the entire week's schedule from the table adjacent to it.\n4. If you are on duty for the day, ensure that you are available to receive calls from Pager Duty. You can access Pager Duty at https://invent-analytics.pagerduty.com/users/PHCDT87 using the username and password provided by Alpha in LastPass. Update the phone section to ensure that you can be reached in case of any problems.\n5. Once you are set up to receive calls, you will be notified if any tasks in the daily_dag fail. These failures may be caused by failures in other DAGs. To determine which task in which DAG has failed, check your email first, and then the relevant Slack channel if necessary.",
