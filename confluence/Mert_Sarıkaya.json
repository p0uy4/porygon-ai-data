These coefficients can then be utilized in clustering, forecasts, outlier detection, lost sales and so on.",

    "content": "coefficients can then be utilized in clustering, forecasts, outlier detection, lost sales and so on.\n\nSeasonality calculation plays important role when using any machine learning model that cannot handle seasonality by itself. Consider the moving average (MA) model, it takes last n observations (say for a product-store pair) and generates forecasts by simply taking average of those observations. However, if the time series is highly seasonal, the forecasts can be biased (over or under estimating). As an example, if the time series is at the end of its seasonal period and our previous observations are in season (higher than usual), then our forecast shall be significantly higher than what we will probably observe. In order to correct this difference, we may smooth our previous observation with their seasonality coefficients (deseasonalize),  apply MA, and apply seasonality coefficient to the final result (seasonalize).\n\nScope",

An observation in high seasonal period may look like an outlier when we compare it with the previous low seasonal data points, but it might be actually what it needs to be. Therefore calculating outliers by considering seasonality coefficients helps us to detect outliers conveniently.\n\nIn addition to those, additional information can be gathered by using those seasonality coefficients. When we want to apply special service levels (or standart deviation parameters) to a product group that sells significantly higher in September (school start period - beginning of autumn etc.)\n\n## Seasonality Calculation",

For stores, potential set is StoreId, StoreCluster, StoreType (Chain). And for the time dimension, we can calculated day effects (Monday to Sunday), week effects, year-week effects and date effects.For some products, start date might not be the first sales date. When analyzing the data, we had come across to some dummy sales; which means a sale happens then there is a long break until the next sale. Therefore there is a need to decide the start date. We check the mean sales and standard deviation of sales for each product for each week. Therefore if the starting week has less than week - standard deviation sales; we eliminate it. This works as a loop until there is nothing to eliminate.There is a need for calendar shifting here. We assume there is 52 weeks in a year (in reference to retail calendar: https://nrf.com/resources/4-5-4-calendar)",

It can handle special day effect and removes this effect from the data. But to calculate these effects we need to introduce this promotions as holidays (let's say if promo rate is below 10 percent, low promo, 10-25 medium promo, 25 above high promo) If we have promo data we can simply split the percentage promotions into the bins. If we don't have the promo percentage data or it cannot be acquired easily we can use ASP instead. Prices of some seasonal products are highly variable, like vegetables, and this can easily affect on sales. It can be separated whether this increase in sales causes from promotion or seasonality itself (or price elasticity).After knowing each promo bin affects how much change in sales, we can remove this promo part from the sales for each product or store base.",

Consider the moving average (MA) model, it takes last n observations (say for a product-store pair) and generates forecasts by simply taking average of those observations. However, if the time series is highly seasonal, the forecasts can be biased (over or under estimating). As an example, if the time series is at the end of its seasonal period and our previous observations are in season (higher than usual), then our forecast shall be significantly higher than what we will probably observe. In order to correct this difference, we may smooth our previous observation with their seasonality coefficients (deseasonalize),  apply MA, and apply seasonality coefficient to the final result (seasonalize).",

An observation in high seasonal period may look like an outlier when we compare it with the previous low seasonal data points, but it might be actually what it needs to be. Therefore calculating outliers by considering seasonality coefficients helps us to detect outliers conveniently.\n\nIn addition to those, additional information can be gathered by using those seasonality coefficients.
