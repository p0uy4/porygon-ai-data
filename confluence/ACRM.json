Here’s a brief look at some notable tables and their contents.\n\n---\n\n1. route_aircraft_simulation\n\nSimilarities used in capacity forecasts. Origin-Destination-Aircraft Subtype is the level that similarities exist. Multiple similarities can exist and one of them is selected using the “priority” info. Table is refreshed daily.\n\nExample information: IST-ACC flights with W20 type aircrafts have similar payload to IST-LOS flights with W20 aircraft type.\n\n1. baggage_kg_per_pax_… / baggage_m3_per_pax_…\n\nThere are 4 tables for kg per pax and 4 tables for m3 per pax from different levels. These tables include baggage estimations to be used for capacity calculations. There is a priority ordering among these levels:\n\n- OD > City > Country > All\n\nEstimations are renewed weekly.\n\n1. capacity_forecast",

Dark green bars are offload.\n\nThe customer said there is no offload correction in capacity forecast results and asked why there isn’t.\n\n---\n\n# Approach and Analysis Details\n\nLooking at the graph at right bottom we saw that capacity forecast (yellow line) goes close to light green bars (realized booking volume). Thus we suspected that offload coefficient found >= 1, so we did not use the coefficient.\n\nRecreating the data from offload coefficient module we saw that capacity forecasts are not too high and offload coefficient is 1.08 and we didn’t use it since it is greater than 1.\n\n---\n\n# Resolution and Actions",

Here’s a checklist of how you can effectively track failed task logs:\n\n## Trouble Shooting Guideline\n\nWhen Trouble Shooting Guideline issues in Airflow, it’s important to follow a structured approach to identify and resolve problems efficiently. Additionally, communicating with the client throughout the troubleshooting process is crucial for maintaining transparency, managing expectations, and ensuring satisfaction.\n\n282\nincomplete\nIs there a Trouble Shooting Guideline (TSG)? (Define the guideline including actions, customer point of contact, etc.)\n\n## PagerDuty\n\nPagerDuty is an incident management and notification tool that integrates well with Airflow to alert teams in case of task or job failures. Teams can use PagerDuty to receive alerts when a task or Dag fails, helping ensure a timely response to critical issues.",

Don't get sucked into the minutia of decision-making or project involvement too early - there will be plenty of time for that later. In your handover process, focus on getting comfortable and learning how things work.\n- Don't be afraid to ask. No one expects you to know how things at the project work right away. Take advantage of that and ask for help when you need it.\n- Be Proactive: If you see areas that could be improved, suggest constructive changes. Fresh perspectives are often valuable for continuous improvements.\n- Stay Organized: Make sure you follow the handover steps in a planned manner and complete all items.\n\n## Client Overview\n\n| Client Name | Turkish Cargo |\n| --- | --- |\n| Sector | Air Cargo |\n| Project Start (Month-Year) | 2021-01 |\n| Go Live (Month-Year) | 2024-02 |\n| Solutions | Demand Forecasting & Capacity Forecasting |",
