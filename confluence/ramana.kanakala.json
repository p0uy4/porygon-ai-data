Using MLFlow, the DS team can keep track of their experiments.\n\n*Experimental machine learning (ML)-based forecasting models are innovative or non-standard approaches that leverage cutting-edge techniques to improve the accuracy and reliability of predictions. These models often aim to address challenges in traditional forecasting, such as handling complex patterns, dealing with sparse or noisy data, or adapting to dynamic environments.MLFlow is often considered part of the broader MLOps ecosystem. While MLFlow focuses on specific lifecycle tasks (like tracking and deployment), a full MLOps platform integrates these tasks into a cohesive system, often adding advanced features like real-time monitoring, automated retraining pipelines, and multi-cloud support.*",

We can apply top-down strategies to break-down aggregate level forecasts to desired levels. For example, you can build your model on product-week level forecasts but we can break-it down to product-store-day week if required.\n\nSometimes, especially in fashion retailers, SKU-store level granularity may not be the best option due to lack of sales volume. In this case, option level granularity would be better.\n\nTL;DR Forecasting level is up to the Data Science team that is working on the problem, and final forecast granularity is up to the downstream solution that is going to consume these forecasts.\n\nNew store and new product forecast generations",
