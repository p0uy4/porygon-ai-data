Go to the github repository page of a product (ex: Opal product repository)\n2. Under the product folder (ex: rocks/opal) there should be a folder named pipelines (ex: Pipelines folder)\n3. In .yaml files there are pipelines defined for each Airflow DAG of the relevant product. For our example, pre_etl.yaml is one of them. In pre_etl.yaml, default tasks, dependencies and arguments are defined.\n4. These pipelines and task configurations can be changed in fabbrica.yaml file of the project.",

Select Base Data, Product for example visual.  Using Pokedex. Get metadata for <table_name>_feed. (GIVE pokedex fetch SCRIPT PATH HERE for default schema)\n- Create the flow of process for complex calculations. This can change from customer to customer a lot. Example: Mattressfirm provides price values in a compact format in clusters of stores, joining cluster store mapping with the data at hand is needed.

The addition of a new table consist of 2 (optionally 3) changes in config.yml and config_metadaya.yaml files.config.yml: In tasks related config section in the file, a new section is added to the sources parameter. The subparameters and their behavior is explained above.config_metadata.yml: In config_metadata file the path of the table is given. For the example we should look for the name store_price_group.key: The path to the file. {raw_data_path} is a parameter and resolved in code. It is equivalent to /mnt/invent-mattressfirm-input/<daily_file>options: Whether a table has a header (in default it should), and the type of seperator (in default its | ). As is usage would be enough.storage_type: The type of storage, could be csv or delta.",

The Importance of a Project Timeline\n\nA project timeline is more than just a roadmap—it is the foundation that keeps projects structured and teams aligned.\n\nAccording to Pam Salon, a well-planned timeline provides:\n\n- Clarity and Transparency – Teams understand their tasks and deadlines clearly.\n- Resource Efficiency – Time, workforce, and financial resources are allocated optimally.\n- Risk Mitigation – Identifies potential bottlenecks and risks early on.\n\nSimilarly, Haralkar emphasizes that a clear schedule improves predictability, allowing managers to anticipate challenges and adjust plans accordingly.\n\n🟡 Interesting Insight: Studies suggest that 70% of project delays are due to poor identification of task dependencies, not task execution itself.\n\nWithout a structured timeline, teams face:\n\n- Missed deadlines\n- Budget overruns\n- Mismanaged resources",

How to Create an Effective Project Timeline\n\nA well-structured timeline includes several key steps:\n\n#### 2.1 Define Project Scope and Goals\n\nClearly outline the project’s objectives and deliverables before building the timeline.\n\n#### 2.2 Break Down the Work (WBS – Work Breakdown Structure)\n\nSplit the project into smaller, manageable tasks:\n\n- Each task has a defined scope\n- Clear assignment of responsibilities\n- Progress becomes easier to track\n\n#### 2.3 Identify Task Dependencies\n\nDetermine how tasks are related to avoid conflicts:\n\n- Finish-to-Start (FS) – Task B starts when A finishes\n- Start-to-Start (SS) – Tasks A and B can start simultaneously\n- Finish-to-Finish (FF) – Tasks A and B must finish around the same time",

Because of this, we frequently encounter a process of running into errors, fixing them, and trying again, which leads to a significant loss of time. Hamster was intended to proactively monitor and ensure the consistency of the project-template, but I’m not sure about its current status. Are the product teams actively using it, and is Hamster still functioning? In my opinion, if a guideline is being prepared, this should be the most critical point to focus on. The project-template must always be up-to-date and compatible. Encountering multiple errors in a newly created customer repository is unfortunately disappointing.",

This misalignment often results in repeated cycles of encountering errors, applying fixes, and retrying — which leads to significant delays. Similar issues were observed during the onboarding of TbRetail, just like with Go Retail, where both teams encountered the same set of challenges.. Although improvements were made in the Alo Yoga onboarding, and errors were further minimized for Mattress Firm, the root cause remains the same: the project-template must stay up-to-date, especially in response to breaking changes in shared libraries. Maintaining this consistency drastically reduces the time needed for the base implementation. Clear and well-planned ETL logic from the start helps minimize back-and-forth during development, making the onboarding process faster and smoother.",

It helps teams to automatically build, test, and deploy applications, thereby enabling faster development cycles and more reliable software delivery.\n\n### Continuous Integration (CI)\n\nJenkins helps in automatically integrating code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository. Upon each push, it can:\n\n- Trigger builds\n- Run automated tests\n- Notify developers of results\n\n### Continuous Delivery (CD)\n\nJenkins enables the automation of the delivery process so that the software can be deployed to production at any time.

How Jenkins scans builds and branches to check for issues.\n2. How to view build results and errors in Jenkins.\n\nAfter committing a change and opening a PR, you should first go to Jenkins (after connecting Forticlient VPN) and find your branch under the project repository. If your branch doesn't appear, you can click on \"Scan Repository Now\" to make it show up.\n\nAfter selecting your branch, you should click on Build Now.\n\nWhen all Jenkins steps for your branch are successful like below screenshot,\n\nyou’ll see a message like this on GitHub.

Once all the steps on the main branch are successful, your change is live.\n\nThe key point here is: If you want to test the change live by triggering the Airflow DAG you’ve affected, you must monitor Jenkins after the merge and wait until the main branch build is fully successful.\n\n## Example Jenkins Pull Request Flow\n\n1. Developer opens a pull request (PR) to merge feature-branch into main.\n2. Jenkins triggers a build for the feature-branch.\n3. If the build passes and all checks are green:Code can be safely merged.\n4. If the build fails:PR is blocked from merging until fixed.\n\n## Pylint and Flake8 Errors in Jenkins:",

Examples of common pylint errors and how to fix them.\n\n`pylint` and `flake8 `are static analysis tools used to automatically check Python code for style violations, potential errors, and overall code quality.\n\npylint is a comprehensive linter that not only checks for coding standards (like PEP8) but also catches logical errors, detects unused variables, suggests code improvements, and assigns a score to the code based on its quality.\n\nflake8 is a lighter-weight tool that combines multiple linters (pyflakes, pycodestyle, and mccabe) to check for syntax issues, style violations, and code complexity.

They have a limited amount of snake skin, can only make 1000 for the season. If Invent orders 300, will it then update ATS to 700? They dont want to have to manually update ATS)-Ability to prevent re-ordering once those maximums are hit on certain Limited Edition products. (Ex. They release 1x a year Birthday Boot, once they sell out of all 1000 they don't want suggestions to buy back into it. Its a 1 time drop with no re-order.)Tecovas faces material constraints for exotic leathers (e.g., python boots), where factory capacity may exist, but material sourcing is limited by a single supplier",

DM is accountable for taking SA’s view into consideration. The SA is responsible for adding labels to the project board tasks they have reviewed to ensure visibility.\n3. For extensions, DM should change the type of the issue of that project requirement to “extension” and ensure the business challenge (request) and their recommended solution is clearly defined in that extension issue.\n4.

For example, rocks-noob might require warp or rocks-core. I suggest upgrading warp and rocks-core even if they don't list dependencies, as upgrading a few versions is easier than many. Omega-ui and cheetah are special cases: omega-ui is always the latest, and cheetah maintains its own version upgrades. Expect them to contact you if changes are needed.\n\nUsually, create a feature branch first, copy data into dev/uat, and upgrade versions in that branch. However, it depends on the change size.
