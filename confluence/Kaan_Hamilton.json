I think just one of the queries leading to the next phase should be enough for the week to be passed on to the next phase of the system.\n\nThe seasonality threshold and special/promo days will be passed as parameters by the user, additionally a default value can be calculated from the set of highly seasonal products in the dataset. So the user can decide which time periods to query.\n\nIf both queries return false then we move on to the outlier detection phase. Before we move on however we should pause to think about Question #1 below.",

However, it may be the case that all reference stores of that store have jumps during that week. So this behavior is probably explainable and is not an outlier.\n\n## Success metrics\n\n| Goal | Metric |\n| --- | --- |\n| Create a synthetic Store/Product from Store/Product reference groups | MAPE w.r.t the original store's weekly sales |\n\n## Objectives\n\nFor a given store or product find the best n stores/products that represent it (that have similar sales patterns ). So that when the sales of the reference stores/products are multiplied by certain weights the result is similar to our initial store’s/product’s sales.\n\n## Input Parameters",

For this we pass the 52 week sales of the reference store and the original store to a Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm that optimizes the weights of each reference store. Then we choose the reference group and synthetic store with the lowest MAPE.",

Given a user provided group by level, the algorithm assigns weights to each forecast\n\nto derive a new forecast within each unique group.
