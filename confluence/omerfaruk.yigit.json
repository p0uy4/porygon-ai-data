    "content": "Hello,\n\nThis doc is prepared for clarifying effect of Handover process’s to Tableau Reports and what to do in Handover Process for Reports.\n\n> Info: Note: The necessity of this document has become visible after whole Tableau Cloud Migration and creation of project, hub based Tableau Cloud accounts\n\n#### What has changed from Tableau Server → Tableau Cloud.\n\nOur old Tableau Server has been used with 1 account which is InventService2 and whole refresh tasks are handled by same user. Also we can manage the whole reporting process with same account because of the non existing MFA configurations.\n\nAfter the migration we noticed that Tableau Cloud needs MFA for logging and that new feature blocks us for using same method as Tableau Server.\n\nSo we switched the our accounting to use project(customer) and CX-Hub based accounts. Which some of them also started using since in Migration.",

So we need to make sure that related hub will receive these failure messages.\n\nAfter changing owner of the report. It is crucial to embed the password and tokens right away.\n\n### How to restore the connections:\n\n### For DBX connections:\n\nEnter DBX token to password field and save.

But don’t worry this will successfully refresh if you are sure that you embedded correct password)\n\n### Why this is needed?\n\nWhen you transfer the ownership of a Workbook or Data Source to another user, Tableau automatically deletes the embedded credentials (database usernames/passwords) associated with that content.\n\nThis is a security feature. Tableau ensures that the previous owner's credentials are not inadvertently used or accessible by the new owner.\n\n> Info: PLEASE CHECK YOUR REPORT’S REFRESH AFTER WHOLE PROCESS AND MAKE SURE THAT REFRESH HAS NO AUTHENTICATION ERRORS",
