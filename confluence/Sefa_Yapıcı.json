    "content": "We created a workflow for taking easier iterations on a new date . By “a new date” we mean an earlier date that has different properties from the current iteration performed. For example, you ran your iterations in 2023-11-05, where a 3 month forecast will cover black friday, christmas and new years sales. But what if you would like to see how your model performs in a setting where you will cover Ramadan and Eid Al-Adha. You could run this workflow to setup the tables that will allow you to make forecast iterations.\n\n# Important Note:\n\n1-) This workflow is reliant on creating another noob folder that is allocated only for the specific run_date you wish to run forecasts. That is why you need to change the `noob_home` variable in the `metadata_config.yml` you are using in Databricks. Be very careful, not changing the `noob_home `variable will overwrite the tables in your datastore.",
